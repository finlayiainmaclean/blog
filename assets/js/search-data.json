Their KG is pretty comprehensive, bringing together the aforementioned Hetionet, DrugBank, the literature-derived Global Network of Biological Relationships, STRING, IntAct and DGIdb. . . The main shortcoming of this KG, is no relationships are mapped to some universal meaning. For example, there are drug-treats-disease edges in GNBR, DrugBank, ChEMBL and Hetionet. There&#39;s also a large bunch of drug-inhibits-gene, each with their own inclusion criteria. In an ideal world, these semantically similar relations would be near eachother in the embedding space.

Inital thoughts on predictions for CP . Octreotide - Definitely the most interesting of suggestions. Octreotide is synthetic analogue of the peptide hormone somatostatin.

In the gastrointestinal tract, the hormone reduces gastric secretion and the emission of gastrointestinal hormones, such as secretin and gastrin. Specific somatostatin receptors can modulate secretory response of the acinar cells via reduction of intracellular cAMP. Researchers have shown IV octreotide raises somatostatin to normal levels in plasma, and reduces circulating TNFα and IL6, reducing severity of the disease. . | Dexamethasone - Large dose dexamethasone is known to reduce severity of SAP, but the mechanism is still not fully estabished. A research group demonstrated that potential mechanisms were related to the inflammatory mediators inhibition and pancreatic acinar cell apoptosis. Another group showed upregulation of PAP genes. Both inflammation and acinar cell apopotsis are shared pathomechanisms in SAP and CP. It seems reasonable that large doses of dexamethasone could be beneficial for CP. . | Ursodeoxycholic acid - UDCA has been shown to reduce pancreatitic enzyme secretion. This paper describes a marked decrease in trypsin levels. This paper shows a protective effect of oral UDCA on pancreatic ductal injury by reducing apoptosis. . | Cholestrol/Simvastatin - Patients with low (&lt;160 mg/dL) or high total cholesterol levels (&gt;240 mg/dL) had a high incidence of severe acute pancreatitis ref30041-X/fulltext). Simvastatin is an anticholesteremic, so it&#39;s logical that lowering high cholestrol levels could have a protective effect against CP. . | Ethanol, ceruletide, L-arginine, pentagastrin - It seems the model has conflated molecules that cause (or contribute) to CP, with molecules that can treat the disease. Ethanol, ceruletide, L-arginine, pentagastrin are all used to induce CP in experimental models. . | Calcium - CP is a calcifying fibrotic disease predominantly caused by Ca2+ dysregulation in acinar cells driven by LoF and GoF mutations in CFTR. It&#39;s promising the model highly associated calcium with the disease. . | Glutathione - There is a known interplay between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+ signaling, and antioxidant therapy has been suggested for CP. Enhanced generation of oxygen radicals cause changes in glutathione metabolism ref, although I&#39;m unsure if a nutriceutical administration of glutathione would affect the upstream process of ROS buildup. . | Progesterone, Testosterone - The appearance of hormones is pretty interesting. Women who have used hormone replacement therapy have a significantly higher risk of developing AP (I think 57% but I can&#39;t remember the source). I have no idea how hormone deficiencies relate to the pathomechanisms of AP/CP. . | . from pandas import option_context with option_context(&#39;display.max_colwidth&#39;, 200): display(scores.head(20).drop(columns=[&#39;type&#39;,&#39;atc_codes&#39;,&#39;inchi&#39;,&#39;inchikey&#39;])) . drugbank_id score name groups categories description . 0 Compound::DB00403 | -0.243431 | Ceruletide | approved | Diagnostic Agents | Caerulein is a specific decapeptide similar in action and composition to the natural gastrointestinal peptide hormone cholecystokinin.

            "content": "This post shows how to use Guassian mixture models for data transformation of RNAseq expression. But first, we need some raw gene expression data. . Holy macaroni, what did we do before Nextflow? In the past, I&#39;ve hacked together a RNAseq pipeline of FastQC-&gt;TrimGalore-&gt;FastQC-&gt;Salmon-&gt;A few python plots for QC. Nextflow&#39;s RNAseq pipeline is so much more comprehensive - see the screengrab from their git repo. Let&#39;s install Nextflow. It seems to work best in docker, so do this outside of colab. . . !wget -qO- https://get.nextflow.io | bash !chmod +x nextflow . Download FASTQ files for one run (SRR4457124) of a study sequencing colorectal cancer biospecimens. . !echo &quot;SRR4457124&quot; &gt;&gt; ids.txt !nextflow run nf-core/fetchngs --input ids.txt -profile docker . Create samplesheet (in our case just two pairsed FASTQ files for one run), and run the RNAseq pipeline. . !wget -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/rnaseq/master/bin/fastq_dir_to_samplesheet.py ./fastq_dir_to_samplesheet.py &lt;FASTQ_DIR&gt; samplesheet.csv --strandedness reverse !nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq --input samplesheet.csv --genome GRCh37 -profile docker . Back in colab, import the gene level psuedocounts from our run, log2 transform, and remove the spike at 0 (now -30). . genes = pd.read_csv(&#39;genes.csv&#39;) ex = np.log2(genes.counts+1e-9) ex = ex[ex&gt;np.log2(1e-9)+1e-9] . Fit a 2 component Guassian mixture model, and compute the means, covariances, and weights of each Guassian distribution. We also need to compute the (approximate) point as which the two distributions intersect. . import pandas as pd import numpy as np import seaborn as sns from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture from sklearn.preprocessing import QuantileTransformer from matplotlib import pyplot as plt from scipy import stats def solve(m1,m2,std1,std2): a = 1/(2*std1**2) - 1/(2*std2**2) b = m2/(std2**2) - m1/(std1**2) c = m1**2 /(2*std1**2) - m2**2 / (2*std2**2) - np.log(std2/std1) return np.roots([a,b,c]) x = np.linspace(ex.min(), ex.max(), 200) qt = QuantileTransformer(n_quantiles=10, random_state=0,output_distribution=&#39;normal&#39;) gm = GaussianMixture(n_components=2, random_state=0) gm.fit(ex.values.reshape(-1, 1)) m1, m2 = gm.means_.flatten() std1, std2 = gm.covariances_.flatten() w1, w2 = gm.weights_ threshold1,threshold2 = sorted(solve(m1,m2,std1,std2)) high_threshold = (m2*0.8+x.max()*0.2)/1 . Lastly, let&#39;s discretize the expression into: . Not expressed | Low expression | Medium expression | High expression | . Let&#39;s define not expressed as anything lower than the mean of the first Guassian and low expression as between this and the intersection of Guassians. For medium expression, let&#39;s define a semi-arbitary point on the second Guassian, say 80% towards the second mean. High expression is just anything above this point. . gk = stats.gaussian_kde(ex) dd = gk.evaluate(x) plt.plot(x, dd, &#39;k-&#39;) # sns.distplot(gbm_ex) def gaussian(x, m, s, w): a = w / (s * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)) b = -(x - m) ** 2 c = 2 * s ** 2 return a * np.exp(b / c) plt.plot(x, gaussian(x, m1, std1, w1), &quot;k--&quot;) plt.plot(x, gaussian(x, m2, std2, w2), &quot;k--&quot;) x_not_ex = np.linspace(x.min(), m1, 50) plt.fill_between(x_not_ex, gk.evaluate(x_not_ex), color=&quot;grey&quot;) x_low = np.linspace(m1, threshold1, 50) plt.fill_between(x_low, gk.evaluate(x_low), color=&quot;limegreen&quot;) x_mid = np.linspace(threshold1, high_threshold, 50) plt.fill_between(x_mid, gk.evaluate(x_mid), color=&quot;forestgreen&quot;) x_high = np.linspace(high_threshold, x.max(), 50) plt.fill_between(x_high, gk.evaluate(x_high), color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;) plt.xlabel(&#39;log2[pseudocounts]&#39;) plt.ylabel(&#39;ratio genes as expression level&#39;); .",

The fgsea package also have a gsea table plotting function. I don&#39;t think this really provides any additional information not shown in the pandas dataframe. The FDR for both packages is worryingly high. Perhaps this is due to either a very small geneset (there&#39;s only around ~600 goprocesses), or a relatively small number of genes with scores. Normally you would run prerank GSEA on the DEGs of a t&#39;omics comparison, and thus would have ~20,000 genes/score pairs. . %%R topPathwaysUp &lt;- old_results[ES &gt; 0][head(order(pval), n=10), pathway] topPathwaysDown &lt;- old_results[ES &lt; 0][head(order(pval), n=10), pathway] topPathways &lt;- c(topPathwaysUp, rev(topPathwaysDown)) plotGseaTable(pathways[topPathways], ranks, old_results, gseaParam=0.5) .",
